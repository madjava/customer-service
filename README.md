# Customer Service

A TDD approach to building REST API

Credit to [*Parri Pandian*](https://github.com/parripandian) whose book i read every page.

Implemented in-memory MongoDb for integration tests using [mongodb-memory-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server) instead of [mockgoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mockgoose-fix).

To run all test run

```bash
npm test
```
